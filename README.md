# Planet-Viewer

### Simple Description
Planet Viewer is a demo project (website) made for me in order to learn shadcn/ui and tailwind using the Nextjs and React 
frameworks. Planet Viewer will (25y-3m-2d as of writing) feature an interactive page for learning about planets, especially 
about their gravity values, composition, average density, inclination, and more.

### Plan
- [ ] fully setup the plan and readme (from what I have plannd)
- [ ] create home page for the website
    - [ ] show info about the website
    - [ ] have github repo link and link to creator
    - [ ] do cool thingy with info section where it goes up when you scroll
- [ ] create interactive planet page (for now just the bg and header for links)
- [ ] create planet images that can be clicked for a script to be run
- [ ] create orbit lines
- [ ] make div where all the info is gna be created by script (make span tags have text and make opacity go from 0 to 100) in the middle of screen
- [ ] make the planets move to above the aforementioned div when clicked
- [ ] create a blur effect behind the text and planet when clicked (gradient?)

bonus: 
- [ ] make translations for the website
    - [ ] translate home page and add translation button
    - [ ] translate interactive page with the texts
- [ ] host website on vercel
